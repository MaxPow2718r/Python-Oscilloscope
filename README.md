#Oscilloscope
Oscilloscope is a short python program use to analyses  simple input signals generate whit numpy (maybe in the future can be added an input from an USB).

##"Installation"
You can download or clone this repository an make it work for sure.

##Usage
You have to give the program the amplitude, angular frequency and time base of the signal. For now it only works with one signal at a time, but I plan on make it work with up to 4 signal channels.

##Objective
The objective of this project its make a basic python scrip with multiple modules, also this is an opportunity to try markdown (that is the reason tbh).
